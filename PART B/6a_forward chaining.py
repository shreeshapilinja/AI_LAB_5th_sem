"""
The code provided in the previous examples is a simple implementation of a 
problem-solving strategy using forward chaining, but it does not involve the use 
of artificial intelligence (AI).

"""

# define the starting information
information = "I have a problem and need to find a solution"

# define the steps to take to find a solution
steps = ["identify the problem", "generate potential solutions", "evaluate potential solutions", "implement a solution"]

# start with the available information and work forwards
print(information)
for step in steps:
    print(step)

# output:
# I have a problem and need to find a solution
# identify the problem
# generate potential solutions
# evaluate potential solutions
# implement a solution

"""
Forward chaining is a problem-solving strategy that
 involves starting with the available information and working 
 forwards to find the solution to a problem. Here is a short Python code
 example that demonstrates how to implement forward chaining to solve a simple problem
 
 This code simply prints out each step in order, starting with the available information and working forwards through the necessary steps to find a solution. You can adapt this basic structure
 to fit your specific problem-solving needs by modifying the information and steps variables as needed.
