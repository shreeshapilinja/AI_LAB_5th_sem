"""
Backward chaining is a problem-solving strategy that involves starting with the goal and working
 backwards to find the necessary steps to achieve it. Here is a short Python code example that demonstrates
 how to implement backward chaining to solve a simple problem:

"""

# define the goal
goal = "find a solution to the problem"

# define the necessary steps to achieve the goal
steps = ["identify the problem", "generate potential solutions", "evaluate potential solutions", "implement a solution"]

# start with the goal and work backwards
print(goal)
for step in reversed(steps):
    print(step)

# output:
# find a solution to the problem
# implement a solution
# evaluate potential solutions
# generate potential solutions
# identify the problem

"""
This code simply prints out each step in reverse order,
 starting with the goal and working backwards through the necessary steps to
 achieve it. You can adapt this basic structure to fit your specific problem-solving 
 needs by modifying the goal and steps variables as needed.
